PiCON-OG
3D Printed Lightgun by iCON

Smaller, lighter version of the iCON featuring a sliding recoil, rumble motor, pump reload, analog joystick, 5-way navigation, OLED display, NeoPixel LED in back, accelerometer, screw in wide angle or fish eye lens connection. All parts (including the one-piece frame) can be printed on an Ender 3. The OLED, NeoPixel LED, accelerometer and analog joystick will only work with OpenFIRE firmware running on a Raspberry Pi RP2040 based microcontroller (Pico, Pico W, RP2040 Zero).

The author marked this model as their own original creation.
